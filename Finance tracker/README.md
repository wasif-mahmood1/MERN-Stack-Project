# Full Stack Personal Finance Web App

This is a personal finance application that allows users to link their bank account via the Plaid API. Current functionality includes basic authentication via JSON Web Token, and the addition, deletion, and refreshing of a bank account. The application will display the user's account balances and transactions. Note that this project is a work in progress - more features are planned to be implemented in the future.
